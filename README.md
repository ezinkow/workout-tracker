## About This Project:

This was a homework assignment as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp to build an application where a user can input workouts on a daily basis, enter new, update, or continue past workouts, and log the exercise.

This was built with MongoDB, Mongoose, express, node, Heroku, Javascript, HTML and CRUD methods.

## Summary of Project:

Opening the app displays the users last workout. From there, they can continue an old workout or create a new workout and log the exercise. The app also shows the user's activity for the last week.
